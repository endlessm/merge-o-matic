For detailed information on the original Ubuntu Merge-o-Matic, see:

    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MergeOMatic


Dependencies
------------

 * Python 2.7 or higher
 * osc
 * apt-utils (for apt-ftparchive)
 * deb (for dpkg-source, dpkg-genchanges)
 * python-pychart

Deployment procedure
--------------------

Install the rpm.

Edit /etc/merge-o-matic/momsettings.py (the OBS repository URLs in
DISTROS will almost certainly need to be customized, for example).

Create an OBS account for merge-o-matic, and give it the needed privileges
for the OBS repository projects.

Switch to the mom user (e.g. "su - mom -s /bin/bash") and do a small OBS checkout
using osc (e.g. "cd /tmp; osc -A https://obs:444 checkout PROJECT bash")
in order to generate /srv/obs/merge-o-matic/.oscrc and agree to permanently trust
the OBS server's SSL certificates.

merge-o-matic automatically runs a cron task under
/etc/cron.d/merge-o-matic

Output files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
merges/$NAME.html (e.g. dderivative-alpha-main.html) : main report
$TARGET.list.txt : list of packages in $TARGET distro that come from the
default source distro group (i.e. Ubuntu precise and precise-updates by
default); packages not in this list will not be downloaded from the default
source repositories.
$TARGET-$SRC.list.txt : list of packages in $TARGET distro that come
from the $SRC source distro group.

Config files
------------

Under /srv/obs/merge-o-matic:
comments.txt : comments, will be displayed in merges/*.html
$TARGET.ignore.txt : packages in $TARGET distro that will be ignored by MoM.

Terminology
-----------

Debian archive terminology can be quite confusing: "distribution" and
"section" are ambiguous terms. Here's some disambiguation.

We consider the top-level construct to be a *distro*, sometimes
called an *archive*. For instance, Debian, Ubuntu, and the Debian
derivative(s) you're managing with MoM are all "distros" in our
terminology. Debian security updates operate from a separate package database
with a different layout, so they're treated as a separate distro.

Distros have one or more *suites*, confusingly often called
*distributions* (in e.g. the Debian policy manual, Debian developer's
reference, reprepro) or *dists* (on-disk layout, MoM source code),
and occasionally *pockets* (which seems to be a more popular term in Ubuntu).
These are either release codenames (wheezy, precise) or more abstract
aliases for a codenamed release (stable, testing, unstable). MoM
semi-consistently uses "dist" for these.

Distros also have one or more *components* or *archive areas* (sometimes
called sections). In Debian these are main, contrib and non-free; in
Ubuntu they are main, restricted, universe and multiverse. MoM mostly uses
"component" for these.

The "Section" field in package metadata encodes a smaller *section*
(e.g. libs) and sometimes also the component (e.g. contrib/libs).

In /etc/apt/sources.list:

    http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      (one mirror of) a distro   a suite     3 components

    http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy-updates main contrib non-free
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      same distro                different suite   same 3 components

    http://security.debian.org wheezy/updates main contrib non-free
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      different distro           suite           components

In OBS, our derived distro(s) are represented by an OBS *project* for each
(distro, suite, component) tuple. These projects are named
PROJECT:SUITE:COMPONENT, where PROJECT is configurable (typically the
name of the distro, but it could also be home:myuser:DISTRO),
and SUITE and COMPONENT are the suite and component names. For instance,
a derivative called dderivative with suites "alpha" and "beta", and
components "main" and "proprietary", would have these OBS projects:

    dderivative:alpha:main
    dderivative:alpha:proprietary
    dderivative:beta:main
    dderivative:beta:proprietary

When merging *upstream* distros (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu) into
our *downstream* distro (e.g. a Debian derivative), we refer to each
(downstream distro, suite, component) as a *target*. Each target
has one or more *source lists*, each consisting of one or more
(upstream distro, suite) pairs. We need to know the upstream distro's
components in order to download package metadata, but we ignore the
component for the purposes of merging.

For instance, we might have:

    downstream distro: dderivative
      \- target: (dderivative, alpha, main)
           \- source list: wheezy+updates
              \- source: (debian, wheezy, main)
              \- source: (debian, wheezy-updates, main)
              \- source: (debian-security, wheezy/updates, main)
              \- source: (debian, wheezy, contrib)
              [etc.]
      \- target: (dderivative, beta, main)
           \- source list: testing+unstable
              \- source: (debian, testing, main)
              \- source: (debian, unstable, main)
